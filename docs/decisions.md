# Design Decisions Log

A running record of the "why" behind key choices in this project, kept as
I build - not written after the fact. Useful for me during Q&A, and useful
for anyone reviewing the repo.

## Week 1

**Decision: save raw JSON to disk before any transformation.**
Reasoning: if the transform step has a bug or the requirements change
later, I want to be able to re-run transformation from the original
source data instead of having lost it. This is the standard "data lake"
pattern of separating raw and processed data.

**Decision: use the national `/status` endpoint instead of area-level
lookups for the first version.**
Reasoning: the EskomSePush free tier does not reliably support area
lookups. Rather than block progress on paid access I don't have yet, I
designed the pipeline around the endpoint that is actually available,
and structured the extractor so area-level ingestion can be added later
without a redesign. Real-world APIs are frequently tiered; handling that
is part of the job.

**Decision: timestamp every raw file rather than overwrite a single file.**
Reasoning: each extraction run is a distinct observation in a time
series. Overwriting would destroy history and make it impossible to
later analyse how the stage changed over time.
